Tribute
=======

This repo is a single file that implements the freecodecamp challenge
*Build a Tribute page*.

It consists of a single HTML file that leverages Bootstrap to create a
simple responsive web page. We do use styles in this page once to
eliminate the underline from anchors--we decided not to have a whole
CSS page since the point of this exercise was to use vanilla Bootstrap
as much as possible.

This repository exists in order to fulfill the requirement that there
be public access to the source code for this challenge.
