Tribute
=======

This repo is a single file that implements the freecodecamp
challenge [*Build a Tribute page*.][TributeChallenge]. A working
version of this page can be found [here][tribute-page]

This project consists of a single HTML file that leverages Bootstrap 4
Alpha to create a simple responsive web page. Note that we use the
`style` tage in this page once to eliminate the underline from
anchors instead of resorting to CSS since the purpose of the exercise
is to investigate how to use Bootstrap to create responsive web pages.

This repository exists in order to fulfill the requirement that there
be public access to the source code for this challenge.
